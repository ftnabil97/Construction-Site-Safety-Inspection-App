I am delighted to announce the initial release of the Construction Site Safety Inspection App (v1.0). This desktop application is programmed to inspect safety measures at construction sites by automatically detecting construction site safety gears in uploaded images or via webcam .

Key Features:

- Image Upload: Easily multiples upload images for safety gear detection.
- Webcam Integration: Real-time detection of safety gears using the device's webcam.
- Built With Python: The Construction Site Safety Inspection App is built with Python programming language to deliver the object detection result accurately and efficiently. 
- Safety Gear Detection: The app utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms specifically custom trained object detection model _[(best.pt)](https://github.com/ftnabil97/Construction-Site-Safety-Gears-Detection)_ based on _yolov8s.pt_ provided by [**_Ultralytics_**](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) library to identify person and construction site safety gears such as Gloves, No-Gloves, Hardhat, No-Hardhat, Mask, No-Mask, Safety Boot, Safety Vest, No-safety Vest.
- Customized Detection: The app not only at default detect all the objects classified, but also provides you options with detecting specific objects on the images as well as webcam feed.
- Capturing Images: While using webcam, you can capture images at any time and the images will be automatically saved in the application folder. This will help keeping records of maintaining safety measures of the workers as well as at sites. 
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive user interface built with Tiknter library of Python, allows for easy navigation and interaction with the application.
- Detailed Results: The app provides detailed results, highlighting the detected safety gears, probability percentage and their locations in the images or webcam frames.
- Enhance Safety Compliance: Use the app to inspect and keep records to ensure compliance with safety regulations and guidelines at construction sites.

 
I believe that the Construction Site Safety Inspection App will contribute to improving safety standards at construction sites and reduce the risk of accidents. We encourage users to provide feedback and suggestions for future improvements.

Thank you for choosing the Construction Site Safety Inspection App. Stay safe!

Please note: This is the initial release of the application.
